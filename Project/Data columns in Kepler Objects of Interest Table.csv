kepid,Kepler Identification or KepID,"Target identification number, as listed in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). 
The KIC was derived from a ground-based imaging survey of the Kepler field 
conducted prior to launch. The survey's purpose was to identify stars for 
the Kepler exoplanet survey by magnitude and color. The full catalog of 13
 million sources can be searched at the MAST archive. The subset of 
 4 million targets found upon the Kepler CCDs can be searched via the 
 Kepler Target Search form. The Kepler ID is unique to a target and 
there is only one Kepler ID per target.",
kepoi_name,KOI Name,"A number used to identify and track a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI). 
A KOI is a target identified by the Kepler Project that displays at 
least one transit-like sequence within Kepler time-series photometry 
that appears to be of astrophysical origin and initially consistent 
with a planetary transit hypothesis. A KOI name has an integer and a 
decimal part of the format KNNNNN.DD. The integer part designates the 
target star; the two-digit decimal part identifies a unique transiting 
object associated with that star. It is not necessarily the planetary 
candidate listed in that order within a DV report, nor does it indicate 
the distance of the planet from the the host star relative to other 
planets in the system.",
kepler_name,Kepler Name,"Kepler number name in the form ""Kepler-N,"" plus a lower-case letter, identifying the planet. In general, these numbers are easier to remember than the corresponding KOI or KIC/KepID designations and are intended to clearly indicate a class of objects that have been confirmed or validated as planetsâ€”a step up from the planet candidate designation.",
koi_disposition,Exoplanet Archive Disposition,"The category of this KOI from the Exoplanet Archive. Current values 
are CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED. All 
KOIs marked as CONFIRMED are also listed in the Exoplanet Archive 
Confirmed Planet table. Designations of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, 
and NOT DISPOSITIONED are taken from the Disposition 
Using Kepler Data.",
koi_vet_stat,Vetting Status,"The vetting status for this KOI delivery.  Current possible 
states are ACTIVE and DONE.  As vetting tests for the null 
hypothesis that a TCE is a planet are performed, the disposition 
of each KOI as either a planet candidate or false positive 
will be updated and, most importantly, may change over time. 
It is therefore critical that the scientific community not 
conduct sample completeness studies on KOI tables that 
remain ACTIVE. Active tables do, however, provide the latest 
information for community scientists interested in follow-up
 observations and disposition activities. After a period of 
 activity, the classification of the KOI table will change 
 from ACTIVE to DONE when all dispositions are judged as 
 final and all model parameters have been updated appropriately. 
 This will typically occur after a new delivery of TCEs to 
 the archive based on a longer data baseline.",
koi_vet_date,Date of Last Parameter Update,Date of the last parameter update for this KOI.,
koi_pdisposition,Disposition Using Kepler Data,"The pipeline flag that designates the most probable physical 
explanation of the KOI. Typical values are FALSE POSITIVE, 
NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE. The value of this flag may 
change over time as the evaluation of KOIs proceeds to deeper 
levels of analysis using Kepler time-series pixel and light 
curve data, or follow-up observations. A not dispositioned 
value corresponds to objects for which the disposition tests 
have not yet been completed. A false positive has failed at 
least one of the tests described in Batalha et al. (2012). 
A planetary candidate has passed all prior tests conducted 
to identify false positives, although this does not a priori 
mean that all possible tests have been conducted. A future 
test may confirm this KOI as a false positive.  

False positives can occur when: 
    1) the KOI is in reality an eclipsing binary star,  
    2) the Kepler light curve is contaminated by a background eclipsing binary, 
    3) stellar variability is confused for coherent planetary transits, or 
    4) instrumental artifacts are confused for coherent planetary transits.",
koi_score,Disposition Score,"A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence in the KOI disposition. 
For CANDIDATEs, a higher value indicates 
more confidence in its disposition, while for FALSE POSITIVEs, a higher value 
indicates less confidence in that disposition. The value is calculated from a Monte Carlo technique such that the score's value is equivalent to the frction of iterations where the Robovetter yields a disposition of CANDIDATE.",
koi_fpflag_nt,Not Transit-Like Flag,"A KOI whose light curve is not consistent with that of a transiting planet. This includes, but is not limited to, instrumental artifacts, non-eclipsing variable stars, and spurious (very low SNR) detections.",
koi_fpflag_ss,Stellar Eclipse Flag,"A KOI that is observed to have a significant secondary event, transit shape, or out-of-eclipse variability, which indicates that the transit-like event is most likely caused by an eclipsing binary. However, self-luminous, hot Jupiters with a visible secondary eclipse will also have this flag set, but with a disposition of PC.",
koi_fpflag_co,Centroid Offset Flag,"The source of the signal is from a nearby star, as inferred by measuring the centroid location of the image both in and out of transit, or by the strength of the transit signal in the target's outer (halo) pixels as compared to the transit signal from the pixels in the optimal (or core) aperture.",
koi_fpflag_ec,Ephemeris Match Indicates Contamination Flag,"The KOI shares the same period and epoch as another object 
and is judged to be the result of flux contamination in the 
aperture or electronic crosstalk.",
koi_disp_prov,Disposition Provenance,Disposition Provenance,
koi_comment,KOI Comment,"A description of the reason why an object's disposition 
has been given as false positive. The following keywords 
are shorthand for certain criterion used to determine if 
a KOI is a false positive:
    

APO: ""Active Pixel Offset"" The pixels showing 
the transit do not coincide with the target star, 
indicating that the transit is actually on a background object.

Binary: Indicates the transit event 
is due to an eclipsing binary, not a planet.

EB: Target is an eclipsing binary, or 
there is an unresolved background binary.

odd-even: The depth of the even-numbered 
transits are statistically different than the depths 
of the odd-numbered transits; this is a sign of a 
background eclipsing binary.

V-shaped: Likely a grazing eclipsing binary.

SB1: Target star is a single-lined spectroscopic binary.

SB2: Target star is a double-lined spectroscopic binary.

A comment field may also contain a list of the minor flags 
as set by the Robovetter. See the documents for the DR 25 and DR 24 Robovetter KOI Flags for detailed descriptions.",

      line-of-sight of an observer and a line perpendicular to
      the stellar surface at an observed point. Coefficients 
      are dependent upon stellar temperature, surface gravity 
      and metallicity. Adopted coefficients are required input

      extracted from archived tables (e.g.,  
      Claret and Bloemen 2011). Limb-darkening coefficients remain fixed during fit 
      minimization. Note that the dependence of limb-darkening 
      coefficients on stellar parameters implies that planet 
      radius does not scale linearly with stellar radius.
