    "# Introduction to Data Science – Lecture 14 – APIs\n",
    "*COMP 5360 / MATH 4100, University of Utah, http://datasciencecourse.net/*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will explore how we can extract data from web-APIs. The first part of this tutorial is based on [this blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/).\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is supposed to be a **well defined interface** for interacting with another program or library. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our case of extracting data via web-APIs, it is a well-defined interface for consuming data (in contrast to web-scraping), or, more generally, for the **interaction with a remote program** on a server. APIs aren't only generated so that you can read data; they're often designed so that you could write custom software to interact with the API. You could, for example, write your own reddit client.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are usually well documented, as the organization that provides APIs wants you to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of examples of sites that have documented APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    " * [StackExchange](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs)  \n",
    " * ~~[Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)~~ (still documented, but now expensive)\n",
    " * [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)\n",
    " * [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi.html) \n",
    " * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)\n",
    " * [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) \n",
    " * and many many more. \n",
    " \n",
    "Some folks compile lists of [available free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).\n",
    " \n",
    "Most APIs require some form of authentication and have rules on what you're allowed to do and what not. Follow those rules, or you will be blocked faster than you can say `GET`. \n",
    " \n",
    "Working with an API is a lot like working with a website, but instead of a human in front of the screen, it's computers talking to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the dominant form of APIs on the web: REST (REpresentational State Transfer). REST APIs use an [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) (a Uniform Resource Identifier; URLs are one specific form of URIs) to specify what you want to do with and API.\n",
    "\n",
    "All API methods in REST are relative to a base URL. E.g., for [cat facts](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/) this would be\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts/random\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A query would look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts/random?amount=3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs can return data in different forms. The most common ones are JSON and XML, and of those two, JSON is now dominant. \n",
    "\n",
    "JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a pretty convenient format, as we'll see. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a very simple example, retrieving the current position of the International Space Station (ISS). We will be using the [requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which will handle our communication with the server."

    " * **400** – the server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.\n",
